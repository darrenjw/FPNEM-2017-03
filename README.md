## FP North East meetup: Hands-on introduction to Apache Spark

* [Meetup page](https://www.meetup.com/FP-North-East/)
  * [March 2017](https://www.meetup.com/FP-North-East/events/237884620/) (this session)
* [Slack channel](https://fp-north-east.slack.com/)

### Advanced prep

To follow along with the examples, you will need to bring a laptop with a recent version Java installed (do `java -version` to check).

In case of a poor Internet connection during the meetup, it will be helpful if everyone could download this [Apache Spark 2.1.0](http://www.eu.apache.org/dist/spark/spark-2.1.0/spark-2.1.0-bin-hadoop2.7.tgz) package to their system in advance. Linux users can download from a terminal with a command like:
```bash
wget http://www.eu.apache.org/dist/spark/spark-2.1.0/spark-2.1.0-bin-hadoop2.7.tgz
```
You should make sure that you have a tool on your system which can unpack a "tgz" file (no issue for Linux users), but there is no need to "install" Spark - we will walk through installation/setup as part of the session.

### Meetup session

These are the materials we will work through during the meetup session:

* [Installation and setup](Setup.md)
* [First steps with the Spark shell](Counting.md)
* [Some commonly used Spark methods](Methods.md)
